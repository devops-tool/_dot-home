inb4 TODO
=========

The symlinker will install symlinks in the normal way for the
_installed_ inb4 files, e.g.

    .home/_inb4/dot/ssh/config
    .ssh/config -> ../.home/_inb4/dot/ssh/config

Before the symlinker runs the inb4 builder must run. First it
compares the _built_ and _installed_ files and if they are
different, aborts (because the installed version has been
modified since it was built):

    .home/stuff/dot/ssh/config.inb4 # source version
    .home/,inb4/dot/ssh/config      # built version
    .home/_inb4/dot/ssh/config      # installed version (symlink target)

If they are the same, we build the new version to _built_, copy it to
_installed_, and then we're done and we can carry on and run the
symlinker.

If they're different we can
    diff -u .home/?inb4/dot/ssh/config

Passes
------

We need to run a check pass to determine what to build and emit
warnings about things it decides not to build; the existing build pass
will then build just those things that the check pass decided were ok.

#### Check Pass

1. Check all built/installed versions and remove any that do not have
   a corresponding source version. (Possibly a separate pass)

2. For every file we would build, check _built_ and _installed_:
   Cases:
    * Missing _installed_: carry on (initial build)
    * _built_ same as _installed_: carry on
    * Otherwise complain:
        * Missing _built_: complain, but no diff to do
        * _built_ different from _installed_: complain and diff

#### Build Pass

1. inb4_cat source to _built_ (done)
2. Copy _built_ to _installed_
