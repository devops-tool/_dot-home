inb4 TODO
=========

The symlinker will install symlinks in the normal way for the
_installed_ inb4 files, e.g.

    .home/_inb4/dot/ssh/config
    .ssh/config -> ../.home/_inb4/dot/ssh/config

Before the symlinker runs the inb4 builder must run. First it
compares the _built_ and _installed_ files and if they are
different, aborts (because the installed version has been
modified since it was built):

    .home/,inb4/dot/ssh/config
    .home/_inb4/dot/ssh/config

If they are the same, we build the new version to _built_, copy it to
_installed_, and then we're done and we can carry on and run the
symlinker.

If they're different we can
    diff -u .home/?inb4/dot/ssh/config
