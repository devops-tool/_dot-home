dot-home: Version-controlled Construction of Unix User Configuration
====================================================================

### Current State

This is still in the early design stages; both documentation and code

### Introduction

`dot-home` is a framework for version control, synchronization and
building of configuration and other files typically found in a home
directory.

This `,dot-home` repo, placed in `~/.home/,dot-home` is the "master"
repo that handles dealing with the building and installation of material
found in all repos under `~/.home/`.
